# Setting Up VMWare ESXi

## Overview
This project documents the process of setting up VMWare ESXi, a hypervisor that allows for the virtualization of hardware resources on a physical server. The project details the steps involved in installing VMWare ESXi to a USB drive using Rufus, configuring RAID 5 for data storage, setting up network configuration with a static IP address, and accessing the server via SSH using PuTTY.

### Skills Acquired
- Installation and configuration of VMWare ESXi hypervisor.
- Understanding of RAID configurations and their advantages and disadvantages.
- Network configuration and static IP assignment.
- Remote server access using SSH and PuTTY.

## Project Details
1. **Installation of VMWare ESXi:** The project begins with the installation of VMWare ESXi to a USB drive using Rufus, a tool for creating bootable USB drives from ISO images.

2. **Research on RAID:** Before proceeding with the installation, research was conducted on different RAID configurations, their pros and cons. RAID 5 was chosen for this project based on the requirements and considerations.

3. **Network Configuration:** During the bootup process, network settings were configured, and a static IP address was assigned to the server to ensure stable and consistent network connectivity.

4. **Remote Access via SSH:** Once the server was up and running, remote access was established using PuTTY, a popular SSH client, allowing for secure command-line access to the server for further configuration and management tasks.

## Skills Acquired
- **VMWare ESXi:** Installation and initial setup of a VMWare ESXi hypervisor.
- **PuTTY:** Utilization of PuTTY for remote server access via SSH.
- **RAID:** Understanding of RAID configurations, particularly RAID 5, for data storage and redundancy.
- **Network Configuration:** Setting up network interfaces and assigning static IP addresses for server management and connectivity.
